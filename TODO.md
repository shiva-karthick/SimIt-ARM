The previous author (weiqin04) from https://sourceforge.net/projects/simit-arm/ listed all these TODOs, however @shiva-karthick plans to fix these :)
There will be some expected changes, will update them soon.

Short-term list:

1. ARMv5 (LDC2, STC2, MCR2, MRC2, CDP2, BKPT, PLD), Thumb, XSCALE extensions
2. LCD, Touch-screen, NIC, Flash, ...
3. GDB remote debugger interface
4. Support for 64-bit host platforms.

Long-term list: 4. Class restructuring for better OOP? 5. Cycle accurate simulator from arm.isa? 6. 6. Direct translation (like QEMU) based on arm.isa?
